        <h2>Understanding Marine Biological Diversity</h2>
        <p>
            The vibrant ecosystems at Manila Ocean Park highlight the richness of marine biodiversity. From colorful coral reefs to majestic sea turtles and exotic fish, marine life plays an essential role in sustaining healthy ecosystems. However, these ecosystems are under threat due to pollution, overfishing, and climate change.

        <h3>Why Biological Diversity Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Biodiversity is vital for maintaining the balance of our oceans. The interdependence between species ensures the health of marine habitats and supports millions of livelihoods, from local fishermen to global tourism industries. Every organism plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, contributing to clean water, oxygen production, and food security.
        </p>

        <h3>What Can You Do to Help?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce plastic waste: Plastics are one of the leading causes of marine pollution. Take small steps like using reusable bags, bottles, and containers.</li>
            <li>Support sustainable seafood: Choose seafood that has been sourced responsibly to protect fish populations from overfishing.</li>
            <li>Join coastal clean-up efforts: Many local organizations offer opportunities to help clean beaches and coastal areas, preventing trash from reaching the ocean.</li>
            <li>Spread awareness: Educate others about the importance of marine conservation and inspire them to take action in their communities.</li>
            <li>Donate to marine conservation organizations: Your contributions can support research, conservation efforts, and rehabilitation programs for endangered species.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Get Involved</h3>
        <p>
            The future of our oceans depends on collective action. Every individual has a role to play in preserving biological diversity. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply passionate about the environment, there are many ways to get involved. Share what you've learned, make conscious choices, and participate in community initiatives. Together, we can protect the beauty and diversity of marine life for generations to come.
